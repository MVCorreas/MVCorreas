</div>

I am a Full Stack Developer with a twistâ€”I hold a university degree in English, and my journey is a fusion of language expertise and programming prowess.

**Technical Proficiency:**
At the heart of my development journey are the technologies that drive innovation. Proficient in REACT, NodeJS, VITE, CSS Frameworks, among others, I bring a robust skill set that empowers me to craft seamless and efficient solutions. Whether it's building dynamic and appealing user interfaces or optimizing server-side performance, I thrive on the versatility these technologies offer.

**Communication Excellence:**
My background as an interpreter and translator has cultivated my precision in communication. In the world of coding, attention to detail is paramount, and my linguistic background equips me with a unique ability to articulate complex ideas clearly, both in writing and verbally.

**Global Impact:**
Having navigated through different cultures and languages, I understand the importance of global collaboration. In an era where software development transcends borders, my proficiency in English and Spanish is not just a linguistic asset but a bridge between diverse perspectives.

**Versatility and Adaptability:**
As a team coordinator and English teacher, I honed skills crucial for any collaborative tech environmentâ€”organization, adaptability, time-management, and interpersonal communication. These roles have taught me to navigate dynamic scenarios and work effectively with individuals at all levels.

**Continuous Learning and Problem-Solving:**
I am not just a developer; I am a lifelong learner. My completion of various programming courses signifies my commitment to staying at the forefront of technological advancements. These courses have not only enhanced my logical thinking but also refined my problem-solving skills, a cornerstone in the realm of coding.

**Belief in Tech's Transformative Power:**
I firmly believe that the roles of today and tomorrow are intertwined with computing. My journey reflects this beliefâ€”I am not just adapting; I am thriving in an environment where the language of technology merges seamlessly with the art of communication.

**Technologies:**
REACT
NodeJS and Express
SQL
NextJS
Bootstrap


In essence, I am a goal-oriented, fully accountable, and well-organized professional who brings a rich tapestry of experience in English, Spanish, and programming. I am a developer, a connector, a problem solver, and a believer in the transformative power of technology. I am eager to contribute my unique blend of skills to dynamic software development teams.
